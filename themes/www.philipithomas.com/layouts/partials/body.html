          I am currently traveling full-time and building
          <a href="https://www.moonlightwork.com">Moonlight</a>. I graduated
          from
          <a

            >WashU</a
          >
          in 2013, where I studied systems engineering and physics. From 2013 to
          2015, I developed engineering systems at
          <a href="https://www.opendns.com">OpenDNS</a>, which

          >. In 2015, I completed a fellowship at
          <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>. From 2015 to 2017,
          I was the founder of <a href="https://www.staffjoy.com">Staffjoy</a>,
          a scheduling startup that
