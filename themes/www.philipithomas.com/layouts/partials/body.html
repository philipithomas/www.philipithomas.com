        <h1>Philip I. Thomas</h1>
        <p>
            I am currently traveling full-time and building <a href="https://www.moonlightwork.com">Moonlight</a>. I graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis">WashU</a> in 2013, where I studied systems engineering and physics. From 2013 to 2015, I built engineering systems at <a href="https://www.opendns.com">OpenDNS</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/30/cisco-to-buy-cloud-security-company-opendns-for-635m-in-cash/">Cisco bought</a>. In 2015, I completed a fellowship at <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>. From 2015 to 2017, I was the founder of <a href="https://www.staffjoy.com">Staffjoy</a>, a scheduling startup that <a href="https://blog.staffjoy.com/staffjoy-is-shutting-down-39f7b5d66ef6">shut down</a> and <a href="https://github.com/staffjoy">opened its code</a>. I practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga">Krav Maga</a>, maintain a strict ketogenic diet, and tinker with fountain pens.
