          I live in NYC, where I am building
          <a href="https://www.moonlightwork.com">Moonlight</a> - a professional
          community for software developers. I graduated from
          <a

            >WashU</a
          >
          in 2013, where I studied systems engineering and physics. From 2013 to
          2015, I developed engineering systems at
          <a href="https://www.opendns.com">OpenDNS</a>, which

            >Cisco bought</a
          >. In 2015, I completed a fellowship at
          <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>. From 2015 to 2017,
          I was the founder of <a href="https://www.staffjoy.com">Staffjoy</a>,
          a scheduling startup that

          and <a href="https://github.com/staffjoy">open-sourced its code</a>.

          <a href="https://instagram.com/queso_fundido">Queso</a>, maintain a
          strict ketogenic diet, and tinker with fountain pens.
